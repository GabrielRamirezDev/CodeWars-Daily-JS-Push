//Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).


function countSheeps (arrayOfSheep) {
    let a = 0;
    for( let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++) {
      if(arrayOfSheep[i]=== true) {
        a++;
      }
    }
    return a;
