//In this kata you have to correctly return who is the "survivor", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.
//Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:

function josephusSurvivor(n,k){

 let survivor = [], duckDuckGoose = 0;
  for(var i = 1; i < n+1; i++){
    survivor.push(i);
  }
  while(survivor.length>1){
    duckDuckGoose += k-1;
    while(duckDuckGoose > survivor.length-1){
      duckDuckGoose -= survivor.length;
    }
    survivor.splice(duckDuckGoose,1);
  }
  return survivor[0]
}
